    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>Nest of Hope Advocacy and Support Community was borne out of experience, and the need to enlighten the society on cancer advocacy, prevention, prevalence, control, treatment, care, Survivorship and Reintegration. It was founded by a survivor who at the time of diagnosis had little or no idea about the disease.
    Our objective is to enhance cancer education and stakeholder engagement towards provision of screenings, diagnosis and effective cancer care. We also offer support from diagnosis through survivorship to manage patient response and perception of the disease and provide practical information to track healing progress. Our programs are emphatic on the healing journey to build a support system for guidance, counselling and peer support to ensure better outcomes and enhance quality of life.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h1>Mission</h1>
    <p>Fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration to improve healthcare systems to minimize cancer mortality.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h1>What We Do</h1>
    <p>We understand that talking about cancer can be uncomfortable for most people and that there is often a stigma attached to it. We have articulated activities and programmes to align with global activities in cancer awareness and advocacy.
    We are dedicated to ensuring that all people impacted by cancer are empowered by knowledge, strengthened by action and supported by the community.</p>

    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
    <p>Empowering people with knowledge, strengthened by the effort of community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h1>Survivorship</h1>
    <p>Cancer patients and survivors become indigent upon cancer treatment, and suffer stigmatization as a result of people's perception, attitude and beliefs. This leads to isolation, business and job loss. Our Survivorship programme focuses on cancer survivors who lost their sources of livelihood as a result of incapability, unavailability to work and burden of cost of treatments. Such persons should be assisted to start up a trade or vocation, which helps to improve quality of life and overall survival rates.
    Nest of Hope provides Peer mentorship, Supportive and Palliative cares, Fundraise to help patients/ survivors get through treatment, recovery and reintegrated to the community.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h1>Prevention</h1>
    <p>Cancer generally is the second leading cause of death globally. It does not recognise status and demographics.
    Nest Of Hope is committed to services which emphasise on behaviour change, lifestyle modification, the need for screenings and early detection of the disease.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
    <h1>Awareness</h1>
    <p>We have chosen to be part of strategic awareness campaigns to enlighten the public on cancer prevalence. Also to eliminate the fear and misconceptions surrounding the disease.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h1>Advocacy</h1>
