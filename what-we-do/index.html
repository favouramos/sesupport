        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Nest of Hope Advocacy and Support Community was borne out of experience, and the need to enlighten the society on cancer advocacy, prevention, prevalence, control, treatment, care, survivorship, and reintegration. It was founded by a survivor who, at the time of diagnosis, had little or no idea about the disease.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Prevention</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Cancer generally is the second leading cause of death globally. It does not recognize status and demographics. Nest Of Hope is committed to services which emphasize behavior change, lifestyle modification, the need for screenings, and early detection of the disease.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Survivorship</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Cancer patients and survivors become indigent upon cancer treatment and suffer stigmatization as a result of people's perception, attitude, and beliefs. This leads to isolation, business, and job loss. Our Survivorship programme focuses on cancer survivors who lost their sources of livelihood as a result of incapability, unavailability to work, and burden of cost of treatments. Such persons should be assisted to start up a trade or vocation, which helps to improve quality of life and overall survival rates. Nest of Hope provides peer mentorship, supportive and palliative care, fundraising to help patients/survivors get through treatment, recovery, and reintegration to the community.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Awareness</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>We have chosen to be part of strategic awareness campaigns to enlighten the public on cancer prevalence. Also, to eliminate the fear and misconceptions surrounding the disease.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Advocacy</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Nest Of Hope drives amongst other things to advocate for patients, raise awareness about the cancer burden, financial toxicity, as well as directing public and private efforts and resources into cancer control and care.</p>
        </div>
